# iOSCodeChallenge

Prior to this coding challenge I have never worked in Xcode, or programmed in iOS, Objective-c
or swift. I am an absolute beginner in these areas. I still don't think I know these programming
environments but I am learning.

## Environtment

- OSX - El Capitan  
- Xcode - Version 8.2 (8C38) // swift 3  
- Running in the iPhone 7 simulator.  
- Late 2010 17 inch MacBook Pro

## Programming Challenge:

Create a static library or iOS Framework using Objective-C that performs the following 3 functions:
- Collects the GPS location (latitude and longitude) of the user at a point in time
- Collects the battery state and returns whether or not the device is plugged in and what percentage of life is left.
- Accesses any publicly available, free API to collect the data of your choice and returns it
       (this should be a network call)

Build a simple application with 3 buttons and a label where text can be displayed. Each button should
call into the three functions of the library described above and output the response to the label.
Your application should consist of two tabs, one written in Objective-C and one written in Swift.
Both tabs should call into the same Objective-C library and perform the same function.

Only use Apple frameworks to complete this task. Fully comment your code explaining your logic and choices
where multiple choices are available. For example, Apple provides numerous ways to retrieve a network
resource, document why you choose the solution you did.

Please send me the full SINGLE Xcode project.

You will also need to set the enviroment in Xcode following the instructions in this
StackOverflow Question.*
